## About

Diablo is a functional language designed to augment research in information security and the natural sciences.

Diablo is an interpreted language that runs on top of a bytecode virtual machine (VM). All the core components of the language are written in Crystal.

It features an intuitive syntax that allows for rapidly developing prototypes:

```
fn hello_world() {
    print("Hello World!");
}
```

Refer to the [getting started guide](https://diablo.pages.dev/guides/getting-started) to get up and running quickly. Also, check out the official [style guide](https://diablo.pages.dev/guides/style-guide) for best practices.
